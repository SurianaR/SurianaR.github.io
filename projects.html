    Have you heard of teeenagers commiting suicide or doing self harm or even being bullied?   Well of course you have because it happens all the time.
    But I bet you think that they must have problems at home or something of its kind, but not according to Jane Riese
    "Seventy-eight percent of gay (or believed to be gay) teens are teased or bullied in their schools and communities, a percentage
    significantly higher than for heterosexual youth". This is problem that is happening worldwide and i think that people should just
    accept others who are different.
    The bullying of teens have very unfortunate consequences to it. Like the death of Matthew Shepard who was beat up and tied up
    to die because people believed he was gay. Also Tyler Clementi, He committed suicide after discovering that his roommate had
    recorded him having a romantic interlude over the internet. Another case is Matthew Lush a famous youtube star who fortunately has
    stayed strong all through his experience of being gay since he "came out of the closet".
     Matthew Lush has been Bullied all throughout high school. He has also been called gay slurs and he said
     "I can't exactly pinpoint a specific time when I have been called a gay slur because it happens all the time and every single
     one hurts just as much as the others". He has also tried to commit suicide and also has done self-harm. Being bullied because
     you are or believe to gay is very difficult and it could happen to anyone. Many people believe that being gay is a lifestyle or
     that people choose to be gay but no, if you are gay you are gay since you are born because thats the ways God made you.
     But also being gay doesn't only affect  someone when they are teens but also when they are adults According to ABC News
     "Before giving blood, all men are asked if they have had sex, even once, with another man since 1977. Those who say they have
     are permanently banned from donating. The FDA said those men are at increased risk of infection by HIV that can be transmitted
     to others by blood transfusion." This is a really big problem because those men who try to donate and help others can't do it
     because of this law. A man's blood could be perfectly healthy and they can't help someone out because they are gay.
    A way that we could solve this problem is that challenge everyone, make their personal mission, that if they see this
    happening to stand up and say something because everybody know that this isn't acceptable. Another way is to educate
    people that lesbian, gay, bisuxual, and trasgender is okay. In 2011 same sex marriage was legalised in New York and I
    think that's what they should everywere. New York state senator Mark John Grisanti said "I could not deny a person, a
    human being, people in my district and across my state and those people who make this a great state the same rights same
    rights that I have with my wife." But most important of all people should stop being so judgemental and accept people for who
    they are because they are just as human as the rest of us. GAY IS  OKAY!!
